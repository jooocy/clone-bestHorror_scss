            <div class="title-bar__detail__info">“Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
                most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced.
                Many come from films that aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.</div>

                        <span>When I discover a film I feel is really special in some way, I usually drag as many people
                            to
                            the theater as possible to see it with me before it’s banished to the streaming realm
                            forever.
                            I’m always excited by the challenge of choosing people I’m sure will enjoy it as much as I
                            do,
                            but I’m not always right.</span>
                        <span>With <a href="#">Under the Skin (2013)</a>, I had about a 50% success rate with people
                            either
                            really loving it or really hating it. With <a href="#">Let the Right One In (2008)</a>, I
                            hit a
                            near 100% success
                            rate with the only complaint being having to read subtitles (which is clearly not a
                            complaint
                            about the movie
                            and says more about the viewer). With Blue Ruin I hit my first home run (did I use that
                            sportsball metaphor correctly?). Now, I’ve only shared it with about 4–5 people, but across
                            the
                            board everyone really loved the movie.</span>
                        <span>Director Jeremy Saulnier needs to write the handbook for making great films on a small
                            budget.
                            The budget for this film was around $420,000, which is
                            just remarkable. I’ve never made a film, but this just seems like an impossible challenge.
                            I’d
                            love to know how they pulled it off. I’m so glad they did.</span>

                        <span>I dare you to watch this film without looking away once. I dare you to watch almost any
                            Haneke film without looking away. They’re very often confrontational and require work on the
                            viewer’s part to decode. I’ve finished Haneke films with other people where nobody really
                            agreed on what we all just watched (The White Ribbon (2009), which is incredible).</span>
                        <span>The Piano Teacher isn’t quite so oblique but it’s definitely a challenging watch. Isabelle
                            Huppert’s performance is one to be studied. In fact, there are several actors that have
                            referenced this performance as inspiration for their own award-winning performances. I do
                            wonder, though, with an actor of this calibre, how do you say, “Um, Mrs. Huppert, in this
                            scene I’m gonna need you to masturbate feverishly while huffing a stranger’s discarded
                            sperm-soaked tissue.” I’m just glad we have someone like Haneke to ask the tough
                            questions.</span>
